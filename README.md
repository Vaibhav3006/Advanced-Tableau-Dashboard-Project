# Advanced-Tableau-Dashboard-Project
Dashboard project on SuperStore dataset

I chose the superstore data set for my dashboard project because of three reasons.

1. Because of the different types of data types available in the dataset; be it categorical, discreet, continuous, date-time or geospatial, the presence of such distinct data types increases the scope of visualizations.
2.  Because of the practical business insights, one can generate from this dataset if visualizations are done correctly.
3. Because its the default data set of most of the tutorials and courses on the tableau.

This video is not intended as a tutorial. Rather through this video, I attempt to showcase some of the advanced capabilities of Tableau, such as, Use of calculated fields and parameters to add interactivity to dashboards and use of filters and actions to generate interconnected dashboards for getting granular insights from the data.
